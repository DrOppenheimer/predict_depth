(process_LCA_counts.sh)
DESCRIPTION: Shell wrapper for process_LCA_counts.r

USAGE: > process_LCA_counts.sh <file_in> <include_ambiguous_counts> <tax_level>

     <file_in>:         NO DEFAULT; string, name of the input file
                        (two column, tab delimited, annotations then abundances
                        first row, first column (annotation header) is blank, first
                        row, scecond column can have a text header)

     <include_ambiguous_counts>: DEFAULT = FALSE;


     <tax_level>:       DEFAULT = "genus" ;string, tax level, one from the following:
                        "domain", "phylum", "class", "order","family", "genus", "species"

EXAMPLES:  process_LCA_counts.sh LCA_test_data.txt
           process_LCA_counts.sh LCA_test_data.txt TRUE order

NOTES: Annoying -- to change argument 2, you have to supply 1 and 2 etc.
There are additional arguments in the function file (process_LCA_counts.r)

*** When would you use one version of merging the counts over the other? ***
  (behavior defined by include_ambiguous_counts)

  If you are interested in a specific organism - you would only want to consider
  the counts that can be unambiguously associated with it, and would choose:
  include_ambiguous_counts = FALSE

  If you are interested in exploring a range of closely related organisms, you
  would want to consider all counts that can (unambiguously or ambiguously)
  associated with it, and would choose:
  include_ambiguous_counts = TRUE

(predict_depth.sh)
DESCRIPTION: Shell wrapper for predict_depth.r

USAGE: >predict_depth.sh <file_in> <col_num> <file_out_prefix> <genome_size> <coverage> <produce_pdf> <show>

     <file_in>:         NO DEFAULT; string, name of the input file
                        (two column, tab delimited, annotations then abundances
                        first row, first column (annotation header) is blank, first
                        row, scecond column can have a text header)

     <col_num>:         DEFAULT = 1; 1 based index of column to process from file_in


     <file_out_prefix>: DEFAULT = "depth_prediction"  ;string, prefix for output file(s)
                        *.txt (& *.pdf if produce_fig = 1)


     <genome_size>:     DEFAULT = 4000000; size in bp of genomes


     <coverage>:        DEFAULT = 30; Desired level of coverage


     <produce_pdf>:     DEFAULT = FALSE;   TRUE|FALSE, produce a pdf visulization of the output


     <show>:            DEFAULT = 10; Integer, number of taxa to show in pdf

EXAMPLES: predict_depth.sh test_data.txt 
          predict_depth.sh test_data.txt 1 my_output 3000000 100 TRUE 20
